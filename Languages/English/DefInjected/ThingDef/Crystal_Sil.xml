  <Sil.description>A light blue pill with a mutagenic serum inside, anyone who consumes the pill mutates irreversabily. Popular on Glitterworlds for the beautiful changes to the body, like the floral-like mutations that sprout around the ears. Infamous on Urbworlds for the lethal toxins that some of the mutations secrete.</Sil.description>
